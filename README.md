# OCABS - the Open CA Basic Service implementation for OpenWrt deployment

This private repository contains a C++ open implementation of the CA Basic Service, to be used for deployement into real hardware, running, for instance, [https://github.com/francescoraves483/OpenWrt-V2X)[OpenWrt-V2X].

This project is highly **work-in-progess** and will not inlude, in its early stages, any BTP or GeoNetworking implementation (thus, "pure" Facilities Layer messages will be sent).

For any question, please write to _francescorav.es483@gmail.com_. Thanks!
